## How It Works?
- A list of Articles is displayed in the ```Feed``` page
- Users can filter the list by ```Author```, ```Source```, ```Category```, and ```Keyword```
- If the user is Logged in, their filter choices will persist in the backend database and they will have a personalized feed every time
